  <p class="bio-paragraph">Hi! My name is Kate Larrick and I am in the second quarter of getting my master's in computer science as a student in UCSB's BS/MS program. I started my career at UCSB as a political science student (the result of obsessively watching <i>The West Wing</i> in the months preceding college application deadlines), but I could not shake a desire to spend my career making tangible and useful products. Later on in the quarter, I spoke to a professor in the CS department about how creating software is so much more accessible than people realize, and how CS classes can give you the opportunity to build and make and create in a very open-ended way. I officially transferred into the CS major in the winter of my sophomore year. Aside from school, most of my hobbies revolve around making things: my favorite artistic mediums are crochet, embroidery, applique, jewelry-making, and graphic design, but I also enjoy painting, drawing, and collage-making. Aside from art, I like to swim, run, read, play guitar or piano, and hang out with my dog (Timmy, short for Tim McPaw).
