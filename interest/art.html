  <h1>Textile Art</h1>

  <div class="text">
    <p>I first learned how to crochet when I was nine years old, and I learned how to sew on a sewing machine shortly afterwards. I then began to sell the items that I made to family and friends while adding embroidery and knitting to my repertoire. I have had many hours of practice with these skills, so I think that I can call myself an expert! Below is a table of textile art FAQ.

      <th><i>Question</i></th>
      <th><i>Answer</i></th>
    </tr>
  
    <tr>
      <td>Which form of textile art is easiest to learn?</td>
      <td>I would say that sewing on a machine is the easiest--the machine does most of the work, and you usually just have to guide it in a straight line. Also, following sewing patterns is fairly simple.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>How do you learn how to make a specific item?</td>
      <td>There are patterns available online for all of these activities--if I have something that I want to make, whether it's a sewing, knitting, or crocheting project, I will look online for free patterns.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Is it useful to know these skills?</td>
      <td>Although making things by hand is often tedious and time-consuming, a textile art project is my go-to gift for the people I love, and the time and effort I put into the project makes the gift extra special. These skills have also been useful for altering clothing, making cheaper versions of expensive items, and general relaxation.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Is textile art actually an art?</td>
      <td>Absolutely! I think that textile art is a hugely underrated art form that is often overlooked because of its history as a task (or chore, even) that only women do. There have actually been an increasing number of textile art installments and exhibits in major museums in the last few decades.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What sort of materials do you need to make textile art?</td>
      <td>For crocheting and knitting, you just need yarn and a hook or needle. For sewing and embroidery, you need fabric and thread, and a machine if you would like (but not required). There are a few extra tools that you can purchase, like embroidery hoops, gauge rulers, stitch markers, and fabric chalk, but these are the basics.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Do these skills require your full focus?</td>
      <td>Following complicated patterns usually requires my full focus, but I will usually do these activities while watching a show or talking on the phone. It took a few months of practice to be able to multi-task this way, but it has now been many years.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What are some good beginner projects?</td>
      <td>For crocheting and knitting, some good starter projects are hats or scarves, since these involve going back and forth in rows or working in a consistent circle. For sewing, you could begin with a simple pouch or tote bag.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>How did you learn these skills?</td>
      <td>I was initially taught by my aunt, who is a middle school art teacher, but I expanded my skills by watching online tutorials and trying to follow patterns for things that I wanted to make.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Can you make things without following a pattern?</td>
      <td>Yes! After developing a solid foundation (of textile art primitives, if you will), I started to make things without following a pattern. I actually found that there is some engineering involved in this process--I have an idea of the final product that I want to make, and then I decompose the product into parts that can be assembled, and then I think about how I would make each part. This is often a process of trial and error.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Is there a connection between textile art and computer science?</td>
      <td>Surprisingly yes! The Jacquard loom was the first loom that could knit complicated patterns (with individual thread control), and it is actually considered a predecessor to the modern computer because it demonstrated the concept of programmable machines using punch cards. The way the loom used stored instructions to automate a task directly inspired Charles Babbage's Analytical Machine, and Ada Lovelace refers to it in her work.</td>
